Description: Maintenance-free client & server backup scripts for Linux
  byteback encapsulates Bytemark's "best practice" for maintenance-free backups
  with easy client and server setup.
  .
  "Maintenance-free" means that we'd rather make full use of a fixed amount of
  disc space.  Management of disc space must be completely automatic, so the
  process never grinds to a halt for reasons that could be automatically
  resolved.  Failed backups can be restarted in case of network problems.
  .
  We use the standard OpenSSH on the server for encrypted transport & access
  control, btrfs for simple snapshots and rsync for efficient data transfer
  across the network.
  .
  Backups should require as little configuration as possible to be safe - just
  the server address should be enough.
