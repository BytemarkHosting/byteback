NAME

  byteback-backup - Back up this system to a byteback-enabled server

OPTIONS
 
   --destination, -d <s>    Backup destination (i.e. user@host:/path).
   --source, -s <s+>        Source paths (default: /)
   --exclude, -x <s+>       Paths to exclude
   --retry-number, -r <i>:  Number of retries on error (default: 3)
   --io-timeout, -i <i>:    Number of seconds to allow I/O timeout for (default: 10800)
   --retry-delay, -e <i>:   Number of seconds between retries after an error (default: 300)
   --ssh-key, -k <s>        SSH key filename (default: /etc/byteback/key)
   --verbose, -v            Show debugging messages
   --help, -h               Show this message

Additional excludes can be specified using /etc/byteback/rsync_filter, which is
an rsync filter file.  See the rsync man page for information on how this
works.

DESCRIPTION

You can set "byteback-backup"  on a daily cron job to start backing up
the server on a regular basis.

Without any further options this will copy every file from the root
downwards.

It currently excludes /tmp, /var/tmp, /var/cache/apt/archives,
/swap.file and /var/backups/localhost which (on Bytemark systems) do
not need to be part of any backup.  To specify which locations are
excluded, add them to /etc/byteback/excludes, one per line.  The
filesystems /dev, /proc, /run and /sys are always excluded.

It is possible to configure a full rsync filter by creating the file
/etc/byteback/rsync_filter, which is parsed to rsync via the --filter
flag.  Note that excludes on the command line take precedence, unless
the filter starts with an exclamation mark, which resets everything.
If you do this, you'll need to specify /proc, /sys, etc manually.  See
the rsync manpage for more information about filters.

It is also possible to add extra rsync flags to the configuration.
The following flags are always set:

  --archive --numeric-ids --delete-excluded --delete-during --inplace --relative 

If you wish to add to that (e.g. --xattrs --acl --hard-links) then
simply add them to /etc/byteback/rsync_flags.  These extra flags get
appended after the default flags above, so they take precedence.

When the backup has completed successfully, the server will take a
snapshot so that the client can't alter the backups, and then "prune"
the backup snapshots to ensure that the next backup is likely to run
OK.

If the backup is interrupted or dies unexpected, running
"byteback-backup" will cause the backup to be resumed, with rsync
saving the work of re-copying any files that hadn't changed.  By
default this will happen automatically up to 5 times, with a 10 minute
pause in between each attempt.
