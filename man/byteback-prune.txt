DESCRIPTION

Unless you are backing up a very small amount of data, backups will
always need pruning, i.e. old backups must be deleted to make way for
newer ones.

This program deals with this operation by deleting old backups until a
certain amount of free space is achieved, which is currently fixed at
10% free.  This can be changed by setting the --maxpercent option.

 * midday today;
 * midday on the previous 6 days;
 * midday on the previous 4 Sundays;
 * midday on every fourth Sunday before that, where the "fourth
   Sunday" is calculated as every fourth Sunday in the Unix epoch,
   i.e.  every fourth Sunday since Sunday 4th Jan 1970. 

So when you ask the pruner to run, the backup closest to the present
time will be the last one to be deleted.  The backup closes to "1 day
ago" will be the second-last, and so on.  We score every backup in
this way until we end up with a "least important" snapshot to delete.

The pruner will not delete backups younger than 7 days.
